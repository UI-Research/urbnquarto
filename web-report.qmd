## What is Quarto?

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a tool for scientific and technical documentation. Quarto works with R, Julia, Python, and JS Observable. It can create a range of documents from simple .html documents and PDFs to full books and websites. 

## Styling Quarto

HTML documents in Quarto are styled with .scss files. PDFs are styled in Quarto with .tex files. 

## Features

```{r}
#| label: load-pkgs
#| code-summary: "Packages"
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)  # for data wrangling and visualization
library(knitr)      # for tables
library(broom)      # for model summary
library(urbnthemes) # for ggplot2 theme

set_urbn_defaults(style = "print")

```

### Figures

Quarto has powerful tools for imcluding images. It also includes native tools for adding alt text directly to images. For example, the follow code generates the subsequent image:

```
![stenomylus](images/Stenomylus.jpg){#fig-stenomylus fig-alt="A sketch of two stenomylus."}
```

![stenomylus](images/Stenomylus.jpg){#fig-stenomylus fig-alt="A sketch of two stenomylus."}

Quarto also allows for easily laying out multiple figures.

```
:::{#fig-camels-combo layout-ncol=2}

![stenomylus](images/Stenomylus.jpg){#fig-stenomylus}

![Hanno](images/camels.jpeg){#fig-camels}

![stenomylus](images/Stenomylus.jpg){#fig-stenomylus}

![Hanno](images/camels.jpeg){#fig-camels}

### Data Visualization {#sec-dataviz}

Quarto works well with `library(urbnthemes)` -- the Urban Institute's R data visualization theme. 

Consider an examples using the `cars` dataset, which contains `speed` and `dist` for `r nrow(cars)`. @fig-histogram shows two histograms displaying the distributions of `speed` and `dist` individually.

```{r}
#| label: fig-histogram
#| fig-cap: "Histograms of individual variables"
#| fig-subcap:
#|   - "Histogram of `speed`s"
#|   - "Histogram of `dist`s" 
#| layout-ncol: 2

ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of speeds")

ggplot(cars, aes(x = dist)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of distances")

```

@fig-scatterplot displays the relationship between these two variables in a scatterplot.

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatterplot
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot of speed vs. distances"

cars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(title = "Cars Traveling at Higher Speeds Take Longer to Stop") +
  scatter_grid()

```

### Data Tables {#sec-tables}

The default for df-print is kable. This is the only type of table that works with the table references. kable works well until there is tons of data, where paged thrives. 

@tbl-stats-kable displays basic summary statistics for these two variables.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-stats-kable
#| tbl-cap: "Summary statistics for speed and dist (kable)"

cars %>%
  summarise(
    `Median speed` = median(speed),
    `IQR speed` = IQR(speed),
    `Median dist` = median(dist),
    `IQR dist` = IQR(dist),
    `Correlation, r` = cor(speed, dist)
  ) %>%
  kable(digits = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 2))

```

### Diagrams {#sec-diagrams}

Quarto has access to Mermaid and Graphviz for creating diagrams. Here is a simple example from the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html):

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result one]
  C --> E[Result two]
```

### Equations {#sec-equations}

#### First Model

We can fit a simple linear regression model of the form shown in @eq-slr.

$$
dist = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \times speed + \epsilon
$$ {#eq-slr}

@tbl-lm shows the regression output for this model.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-lm
#| tbl-cap: "Linear regression model for predicting price from area"

dist_fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
  
dist_fit %>%
  tidy() %>%
  kable(digits = c(0, 0, 2, 2, 2))

```

#### Second Model

Let's fit a more complicated multiple linear regression model of the form shown in @eq-mlr. 

$$
dist = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \times speed + \hat{\beta}_2 \times speed ^ 2 + \epsilon
$$ {#eq-mlr}

@tbl-lm2 shows the regression output for this model.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-lm2
#| tbl-cap: "Second linear regression model for predicting price from area"

dist_fit2 <- lm(dist ~ poly(speed, degree = 2, raw = TRUE), data = cars)
  
dist_fit2 %>%
  tidy() %>%
  kable(digits = c(0, 0, 2, 2, 2))

```

### Cross references

This document is littered with cross references. These are easy to add with tags and to reference with `@`. 

## Callouts {#sec-callouts}

:::{.callout-note}
This template is incomplete and we are always looking for help to expand it!
:::

:::{.callout-warning}
Caution, quarto is so powerful you may abandon LaTeX. 
:::

:::{.callout-important}
Reproducible work is a cornerstone of quality research. Quarto makes reproducible work easy and fun. 
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
Use `library(urbntemplates)` to access Urban Institute quarto templates.

## Citations

Quarto simplifies adding citations to the text of a document and the reference section. It also has powerful [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) integrations. For example, the following text generates the subsequent output.  

```
We're going to do this analysis using literate programming [@knuth1984].
